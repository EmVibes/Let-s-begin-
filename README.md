# Hi, I'm Emilie (or Em') ðŸ‘‹

I'm 25 years old and I have a degree in Italian language, with a focus on English and the intercomprehension of Romance languages. 
Although I come from a literary background, I am very curious to explore a new field : science and technology.

From October to December 2024, I attended a training course in computer science and AI at Simplon. 

Currently Iâ€™m enrolled in the Apple Foundation Program, where I learn to code with Swift (on Xcode) and develop an iOS application on the theme of our choice. 
We work in small groups on a specific topic. 

This profile is my starting point in this learning journey, and I'm excited to see what I can accomplish !
