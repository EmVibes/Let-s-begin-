# Hi, I'm Emilie (or Em') ðŸ‘‹

I'm 25 years old and I have a degree in Italian language, with a focus on English and the intercomprehension of Romance languages. Although I come from a literary background, I am very curious to explore a new field: science and technology.

I don't know anything about coding or GitHub, but I am motivated to learn and develop skills in these fascinating areas. My goal is to dive into the scientific universe, particularly through data science and machine learning.

This profile is my starting point in this learning journey, and I'm excited to see what I can accomplish!

## My Goals
- Learn the basics of coding and GitHub
- Explore data science and machine learning
- Develop knowledge in scientific technologies to broaden my horizons
